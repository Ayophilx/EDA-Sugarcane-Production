# EDA-Sugarcane-Production
In this repository, you will find a Jupyter Notebook in which an analysis of sugarcane production is performed. Python programming 
language is essentially used for this project, with data analysis libraries including Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib.
Herein this repository is the data set used and it is tagged " Sugarcane Production.csv "

# Dataset Description
The dataset provides insights into sugarcane production levels across different countries around the world.
The observations are categorized into six different columns namely;
     1.   Country                    
     2.   Continent               
     3.   Production (Tons)           
     4.   Production per Person (Kg)  
     5.   Acreage (Hectare)           
     6.   Yield (Kg / Hectare
# Data Cleaning
The original dataset was not suitable for analysis, hence appropriate cleaning was required.
The data cleaning steps include removing irrelevant columns, removing NaNs, removing redudant rows and converting numerical values to appropriate data types by removing
characters such as commas and dots. Lastly some columns are renamed for better nomenclature.

# Question(s) for Analysis
  1. How many countries produce sugar cane by in each continent?
  2. Which Country is the Largest Producer?
  3. What Continent produce largest amount of SugarCane?
  4. Which country cultivates highest land?
  5. Which country has highest yield per hectare?
  6. Which country has highest production per person?
  7. Do Continents with highest land produce more sugarcane?
  8. Do countries which yield more sugarcane per hectare produces more sugarcane in total?
  9. Do continent with highest land produces more sugarcane?
  10. Do number of countries in a Continent affect production of sugarcane?

# Correlation Analysis
The correlation analysis examines the connections between numerical variables, with a heatmap being utlizied to illustrate the correlation
matrix and pinpoint any significant relationships
